o This file contains steps for building toolchain and building the image.

Procedure:
1) It must be in normal user mode.
2) Install fakeroot before building GPL code.

3) Building the toolchain
 ~# ./build_tool_chain.sh

   Please choose the "Target Ptocessor Architecture" as "MIPS32 (CONFIG_MIPS_ISA_MIPS32)",
   and keep other settings as the default value.

        uClibc 0.9.27 compatibility (DL_FINI_CRT_COMPAT) [N/y/?] (NEW)

  After build toolchain successfully, you will get the prompt line,
  "Use source ./setupenv to setup your environment variables !".
  You can use the toolchain to build image now.


4) Building the image
 ~# source ./setupenv
 ~# make
 ~# make
 ~# make
     ===================================================
	 You are going to build the f/w images.
	 Both the release and tftp images will be generated.
	 ===================================================
	 Do you want to rebuild the linux kernel ? (yes/no) : yes

   After make successfully, you will find the image file in ./images/.
   
   Upgrade the new firmware by web interface provide by device,
   then you will get your specific image.
