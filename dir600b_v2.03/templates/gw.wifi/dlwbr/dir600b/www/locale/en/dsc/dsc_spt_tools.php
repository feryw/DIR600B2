		<strong>Device Administration</strong><a name=12></a><br>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Administrator password</em></strong> -
			Enter and confirm the password that the <strong>admin </strong> account will use to access the router's management interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Remote Management</strong><br>
			Remote Management allows the device to be configured through the WAN (Wide Area Network) port
			from the Internet using a web browser. A username and password is still required to access the
			router's management interface.<br>
			<strong><em>IP Allowed to Access</em></strong> -
			This option allows users to specify a particular IP address from the Internet to be allowed to access the router
			remotely. This field is left blank by default which means any IP address from the Internet can access the router
			remotely once remote management is enabled.<br>
			<strong><em>Port</em></strong> - Select the port which will be used to access the <?query("/sys/modelname");?>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Example: </em></strong><br>
			http://x.x.x.x:8080 whereas x.x.x.x is the
			WAN IP address of the <?query("/sys/modelname");?> and 8080 is the port used for the Web-Management interface.

		<b>Firmware Update</b><a name=15></a><br> 
		You can upgrade the firmware of the device using this tool. Make sure that the firmware
		you want to use is saved on the local hard drive of the computer. Click on <strong>Browse </strong>
		to search the local hard drive for the firmware to be used for the update. Upgrading the firmware
		will not change any of your system settings but it is recommended that you save your system settings
		before doing a firmware upgrade. Please check the D-Link <a href=<?query("/sys/supporturl");?>>support site</a>
		for firmware updates or you can click on <strong>Check Now</strong> button to have the router check the
		new firmware automatically.

			<strong>DDNS Setting </strong><a name=16></a><br>
			Dynamic DNS (Domain Name Service) is a method of keeping a domain name linked to a
			changing (dynamic) IP address. With most Cable and DSL connections, you are assigned
			a dynamic IP address and that address is used only for the duration of that specific
			connection. With the <?query("/sys/modelname");?>, you can setup your DDNS service and
			the <?query("/sys/modelname");?> will automatically update your DDNS server every time
			it receives a new WAN IP address.<br>
			<strong><em>Server Address</em></strong> - Choose your DDNS provider from the drop down menu.<br>
			<strong><em>Host Name</em></strong> - Enter the Host Name that you registered with your DDNS service provider.<br>
			<strong><em>Username</em></strong> - Enter the username for your DDNS account.<br>
			<strong><em>Password</em></strong> - Enter the password for your DDNS account.

			<strong>System Check</strong><a name=17></a><br>
			This tool can be used to verify physical connectivity on both the LAN and Internet (WAN) interfaces.
			It is an advanced feature that integrates a LAN cable tester on every Ethernet port on the router.
			Through the graphical user interface (GUI), Cable Test can be used to remotely diagnose and report
			cable faults such as opens, shorts, swaps, and impedance mismatch. This feature significantly reduces
			service calls and returns by allowing users to easily troubleshoot their cable connections.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Ping Test</strong><br>
			This useful diagnostic utility can be used to check if a computer is on the Internet.
			It sends ping packets and listens for replies from the specific host. Enter in a host name or the IP
			address that you want to ping (Packet Internet Groper) and click <strong>Ping </strong>. The status of
			your Ping attempt will be displayed in the Ping Result box.
